So I just got my hands on a copy of Data Analysis with Open Source Tools, by Philipp K. Janert (O'Reilly). [amazon link or whatever]

When you get a new data set, one of the first things you can do to try to understand it is make a visualization, so that you can look for patterns in the data. Your mileage will vary depending on the characteristics of your data and the type of visualization you choose. 

Some useful visualizations and their relative strengths and weaknesses include:

- Dot Plots
  - often feature data points plotted along a single axis
  - simple and easy
  - points can overlap, making it difficult to see the distribution

- Jitter Plots
  - the points on a Dot Plot can be "jittered" on a second axis, in order to space the points apart better so that they don't overlap and can be seen.
