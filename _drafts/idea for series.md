  you really need to write a long poetic rant about the virtue of science, as a method and way of thinking, and the value of truly knowing something, the difference between "knowing" vs merely thinking that we know. 
  **this will be a series
    1. title "What does it mean to "know" 
      Science as a way of knowing:
      case study - the demon haunted world?
    your experience with MRI research and Pippa and how it gave you a deep appreciation for what a steep learning curve exists to merely develop the prerequisite skills for even being useful on a team undertaking such a complex and difficult endeavor,
    deep respect and appreciation for how fucking tedious science can be - because it has to be, because that's the price of true knowledge. Science is how we separate what we know from the bunk. 
    - Carl Sagan, Neil DeGrasse Tyson?, James Randi (who else can we expose these children to? lol) Michael Shermer, (Sam Harris?), Decartes and the birth of the scientific method, of scrutiny and critical thought; 
      don't miss the caveat, that scientists must be open to possibilities, but must also demand evidence.  
    - experience with astrology, problems with confirmation bias, the importance of a coin toss and looking for significance beyond 50/50%.   
    - make it personal? in order to claim some authority? to admit vulnerability, fallibility, blind acceptance and superstition because of the absence of critical thinking skills?
    
    2. Superstition and unfounded claims 
    case study - michael shermer, why do people believe strange things? 
      the burden of proof falls on the one making the claim
      correlation does not equal causation 
    
    3. Misinformation on the Internet is, and will always be, a problem. 
    One of the attributes of the Internet — the fact that nearly anyone can publish on it — creates an environment of freedom and simultaneously an environment that lacks quality control.
    http://www.infotoday.com/searcher/sep00/piper.htm "While Web literacy demands intelligent Internet use, Web literacy is really not qualitatively different than information literacy. All information has bias and has to succumb to rigorous evaluation. This was driven     home to me when I worked for disaster relief and began exploring refugee statistics. Even when reading an article in The New England Journal of Medicine, it doesn’t hurt to look again — there may be an article in JAMAnext month that refutes it."
      how to parse truth from fiction, misinformation or pseudoscience
      how to parse opinion from fact
      help with evaluating the potential reliability of a source; the idea that certainty is never 100%, but can approach higher degrees along a spectrum of uncertainty taking a moment to acknowledge and appreciate how difficult it really can be to truly KNOW something
