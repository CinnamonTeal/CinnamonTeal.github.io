# #civictech #opendata #opengov


In lieu of our upcoming app project at Flatiron, I decided to do some reconaissance at the CodeAcross NYC hackathon, hosted at BetaNYC, in hopes of gathering some intel and inspiration that I might be able to use. This wasn't my first hackathon, although in hindsight I don't think this is really a hackathon. On the [event page](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/codeacross-nyc-2015-nycs-opendata-civictech-festival-tickets-15578652168) it's described as a "two day festival of, or related to, liberating government data and civic technology," which is more accurate.

**Here's what I thought:**

In the end it was pretty inspiring to see how many ideas and how much passion people have about making nyc better. A sense of civic duty is something that I have always felt, and I think that is a big part of what drew me to this event. It got off to a very very slow start though. Way too much preamble and introduction. IBM was there, and they had their own room/stage with their own events separate catered food (that only they were allowed to eat) which I thought was a bit strange. It felt strange that they were so segregated in what such a collaborative environment. I was impressed by the sheer number of projects and talks that were happening, and it was actually kind of a crisis of FOMO for me because everything sounded so interesting that I felt more acutely my awareness of what I was missing out on, rather than what I was getting to see.

**Here's what I learned:**

Almost exactly 3 years ago (March 7 2012) "Local Law 11" was signed. Here is an excerpt from ยง1:

>The council hereby finds and declares that it is in the best interest of New York city that its agencies and departments make their data available online using open standards. Making city data available online using open standards will make the operation of city government more transparent, effective and accountable to the public. It will streamline intra-governmental and inter-governmental communication and interoperability, permit the public to assist in identifying efficient solutions for government, promote innovative strategies for social progress, and create economic opportunities.

Because of this, NYC has a ton of freshly available data that we can access and use, and many developers already are. I learned that NYC has its own [Developer Portal](http://developer.cityofnewyork.us/) where we can find city specific apps and api's. I also learned about the [NYC Open Data](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/) sets, and a company called [Socrata](http://www.socrata.com/) that makes them available. They also made this cool interactive [introduction](https://socrata.github.io/presentations/hackathons/kickoff/#/) to their [Soda API](http://dev.socrata.com/) which allows even easier to the data sets. 

I found a lot of pretty cool data sets dealing with bicycle and traffic data, and as an avid urban cyclist I think I want to work with one of these sets in my app. One thing the city definitely needs more of is [bike parking](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Transportation/Bicycle-Parking/qpbf-g2yx). One thing the city also needs LESS of is police who give tickets to cyclists for things that aren't even illegal, but police data is currently hard to find. Hopefully in the future we will see more of that. 

I am excited about the CLI app I am about to create. I wonder what it will be...
