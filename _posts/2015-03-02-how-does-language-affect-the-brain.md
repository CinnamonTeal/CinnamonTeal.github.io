title: How Does Language Affect the Brain?
---

This post is for an assignment at the Flatiron School, in which we were asked to listen to a podcast(link), watch a video(link), and write a response to the following questions:

1. How does language affect the brain?
  
  Probably in more ways than we are yet aware of. An analogy that immediately comes to mind is that language is a tool of expression, and like any other tool, it lets us do certain things better, but only those certain things. For example, with a drill we can more easily make precise holes, but there isn't much more we can use a drill for. The podcast beautifully articulated concepts that weren't new to me, but that I also couldn't as precisely express. Trying to imagine what it must have been like to be the man who was born deaf, and didn't have language was an especially illuminating exercise for me. His moment of epiphany (when he realized that "everything has a name") blew my mind.

  One of the comments in the podcast really resonated with me: "â€¦as you move through the world, if you're sensitive at all, and you're observant, you're going to get filled up with all these things that you have to express, but can't, until you get those words, and boom, the door opens." I feel that, having newly acquired a foreign language, I am more sensitive to these ideas as of late. Obviously we (by 'we' I mean myself and my fellow classmates at Flatiron) are sensitive to these ideas as learners of several new programming languages. There is so much we want to be able to 'express,' to 'build,' to 'do,' but we just can't until we have the 'methods,' or the 'words.' 

  Worth pointing out is that whatever language we speak, it was learned. That means that every idea we have ever had was at least in part learned from other people around us or other aspects of our environment. As children we didn't have concepts like "empathy," or "intelligence," or "derivative," until we learned them, and we learned them by learning the words for them.

  Bret Victor caught my attention with a particular turn of phrase in his talk. As he was discussing the ways technology can limit us to only a few of our multiple modes of understanding, he mentioned that "...regardless of what you are trying to express, you express it in symbols, because that's what the interface encourages you to do." But it isn't simply what the interface encourages - it's what the interface limits you to. 

  Because language is an interface that allows us to express - to externalize our thoughts, the thoughts that we are able to express are limited to the features of our language.

2. If language changes what our brain is capable of thinking, how might learning to program change how we think?

  Before learning to program people often agonize about which language they should learn first. The answer eventually ends up being "it doesn't really matter," because when you are first learning how to program you are learning what is called "programmatic thinking." I really appreicate this term for its ability to really express what is going on in the mind of the beginner, and I feel like it perfectly captures the challenge of the struggle wrought learning process which now defines my daily existence. 

  I am learning to think "programmatically." I am learning how to express a concept in a new way. In  particular I am learning to break down normally intuitive concepts (for human users of human lanugage interfaces) and reformat them into some sort of a compromise-interface between an extended set of abstract symbols that my human brain can make use of, and the binary bits that my computer can make use of. I am grateful for the work of all of the symbol punchers before me who created the scaffolding that allows me to lazily command my machine (assembly anyone?)

3. Have you noticed how you think changing? If you have, is it for better or worse?

  Better or worse are relative concepts and hard to define. I would prefer terms like expanding or narrowing, which would make my answer "yes," and "both."

4. How might programming language choice change how you think? Could it affect what problems you can solve and how you approach solving problems?

  Absolutely... I feel like the answer to this question might be obvious. It's one of the reasons for all of the debate about which programming languages allow a programmer to do x rather than y, etc. Evidently the answer is yes. Not just programming languages but also human languages. For example, in Greek there are four words for four different types of love (eros, philia, agape, and storge), whereas in english we simply have the one word 'love.' No wonder relationships can be so confusing. Hence we invent terms like "brotherly love," to bypass the inadequacies of language. In other languages and cultures certain concepts have no words, and so do not exist.

5. Could your editor affect your ability to think/program?
How might the medium in which you program affect your programs and thoughts?

  Again, likely in more ways than I can yet imagine. But I prefer Sublime Text because it allows me to see syntax in color, and offers powerful time saving features like auto complete. If I can more easily vizualize my code then I can better understand it, if I can better understand it then I can more effectively create it.
