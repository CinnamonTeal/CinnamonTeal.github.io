Holy shit this has been such a pain in the ass...

I have been struggling with Jekyll and Github pages all weekend. After using Medium.com as my blogging platform, I decided it wasn't fitting of a web dev in training to blog on such a 'writerly' platform and that I should build my own. 

Finally I got this thing up and running. Not in the best shape, but respectable. More to come.
