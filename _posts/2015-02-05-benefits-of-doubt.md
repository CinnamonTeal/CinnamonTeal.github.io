>"If we are not able to ask skeptical questions, to interrogate those who tell us that something is true, to be skeptical of those in authority, then, we are up for grabs for the next charlatan (political or religious) who comes rambling along.” — Carl Sagan

I want to talk about truth. How do we know what we know? What is reality? What tools do we have to assess this?

Trying to figure out what the hell is going on in your code will be exponentially harder without the proper tools, and the same is true about life in general.

As programmers we tend to be highly opinionated people, and we love to talk about our tools. Emacs or Vim? IRB or Pry? (Pry). But there is a set of tools that programmers use all the time without really noticing, or talking about. Critical thinking skills.

I’m talking about the Scientific Method. This is literally what we mean when we drop slang like “test-driven development” or “fail fast.”

What is happening in my code? What is *reality*? We start with a model of how things work, also known as a *hypothesis*, and then we begin testing it. Our model, our hypothesis, is useful only if it is able to accurately make predictions. This is a key point that people often miss when discussing science, but let’s unpack that a little bit.

Why does science have such an aura of authority? What gives it any authority at all? Among other things, it is able to accurately make predictions. If I a team of engineers is building a bridge between Manhattan and Brooklyn, we want their models to be able to accurately predict that it will not collapse. We need to KNOW that we really, actually KNOW that the bridge will not collapse, not simply to BELIEVE. Knowing if something is true or not *actually matters*.

Often people complain that “science is wrong about ___,” or make misguided claims such as “science doesn’t know everything.” But science is not a noun, it’s a *verb*. It’s not a person, place or tangible thing; it's a *method*, it’s something that you do. Or as my hero Carl Sagan would put it:

>“Science is more than a body of knowledge. It is a way of thinking; a way of skeptically interrogating the universe with a fine understanding of human fallibility.”

**Science is test-driven development.** Science is a *method* for testing your model of reality, and seeing if what you would expect to happen is what actually happens. If it doesn’t then it means your model is broken.

This has become a very popular way of doing things over the last few centuries, mostly because: it works.

When someone says your code will work if you simply call some chained method onto your hash, you don’t have to “have faith” that they know what they are talking about. You can TEST it! You can pop open a tab for Pry in terminal and see exactly what’s going on.

<!-- Testing our model of reality is the gateway to truth and understanding -->

As programmers we do this all day long every day. But this isn’t only true about programming, this is also true about EVERYTHING we encounter on a day to day basis. Can those crystals really cure cancer? Are you really bad at math? Is that thing that you heard that someone told you really true? Can white people really not jump? Is it fact because the news said it? Is there really a god(s)?

What I am urging you, dear reader, to consider, is to let not merely your programming be test-driven, but also your life.
