title: A Meditation on Identity

**4.4.15** 13:19

I've wanted to be a programmer for a very long time. I've also always hated the idea I am merely what I do. I consider myself a generalist, or a jack of all trades. I am curious about everything. I don't want to specialize - specialization is for ants. Who am I? What am I? I feel like I gain new insights into the answers to these questions every day. The answer also changes depending on who I am talking to. That's natural though, and true for all of us. Which is what makes social media so weird... this weird public persistence of fragmented interpretations of ourselves...

Ourselves... the self... I meditate often. I don't think there even exists a single unified "self" that we can locate or identify. It feels like an illuson caused by the interaction of various systems in the brain. Google split brain experiments - that alone pretty much destroys any claim that consciousness is a unified anything that can exist independently of brain matter. 

But there is the illusion of the self. We think about it, some of us more often than others I'd imagine. Who am I? It has something to do with where I'm from, but it's not exactly that. It has something to do with my personality, but that hasn't always been the same either, and almost all of our behaviors are learned...

I had a moment today. It suddenly occurred to me that I am a programmer. When did that happen? For the longest time programming was just a skill that I was learning -- it was something that I could do. What is that point at which something becomes "what I am" or "what I do" not just "something that I CAN do" or "something I am learning?"

It strikes me as odd, because I usually resist defining my own identity in any sort of fixed way. I have been, am, and will be many things. But on some level, it's true. I spend 10+ hours a day including weekends reading, writing and debugging code...

I am a programmer. Programming is what I do.
