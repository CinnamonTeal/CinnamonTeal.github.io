For our next assignment at the Flatiron school, we are apparently going to be uprooting some common assumptions about self-limiting beliefs. First we will be answering some questions, and then listening NPR’s Invisibilia Podcast. My answers are italicized.

**1. Can blind people ride bikes (a normal bike with no technology)?**
  <br>*I wouldn’t think so.*

**2. Can you make a rat faster by believing it’s smart?**
  <br>*I can’t imagine how.*

**3. How does fear affect your life?**
  <br>*At times it is rational and protective, at other times it is irrational and destructive.*

**4. How do expectations affect what’s possible for yourself?**
  <br>*I have noticed in my own life that my expectations affect my experience. The psychological weight of framing something as difficult makes it more difficult, but imagining something as easy removes the unhelpful and distracting angst, making something actually feel easier.*

**5. How do others expectations affect what’s possible for you?**
  <br>*I’d like to pretend that they don’t, but they absolutely do. I have learned to pay attention to that, because others’ occasionally low expectations are insidiously damaging, and unless I am aware of it, they often go unchallenged. Identifying and challenging this in my mind is a skill that I have developed over time, but can nevertheless feel draining.*

**6. For example, can people’s beliefs about you make you smarter, faster, stronger?**
  <br>*Indirectly I think yes. Others’ expectations can alter one’s own expectations about themselves, and it has a subtle but powerful impact on things like effort, attitude, and how one perceives and evaluates one’s own experiences.*

After listening to the podcast, I was shocked, yet at the same time relieved. I was inspired to hear the story of Daniel Kish riding a bicycle despite being blind, and completely amazed that he could (more or less) develop ‘echo location’ on his own as a young boy.

The question of whether or not a rat can be made faster simply by believing it is smart, is misleading because it invokes some sort of supernatural or superstitious explanation, such as telepathy or psychic powers. But after listening to the podcast, I found that their more prosaic explanation makes perfect sense. The researches detail a rational chain of causailty rooted in the physical world; no spooky superstition or mysticism required.

The causal chain is essentially this: the researchers’ expectations changed the way they treated/handled the mice, in turn changing the way the mice felt and performed. This has obvious implications for how we treat each other, and the effect that it can have on our own performance and experiences.

I found this information comforting, because it more or less confirmed the answers I gave to the second half of the questionnaire at the beginning of this exercise. But it also offered very practical and grounded explanations for something which to me was only speculation before.

Our expectations have a very powerful role in shaping our experiences, and the expectations of others can both elevate or damage our own expectations of ourselves if we aren’t aware of it.

Circling back to the podcast, the central question posed at the end is whether or not blind people could come to see again simply by changing their expectations. Again, the question is problematically vague, because what it means to ‘see’ is a bit of a metaphor in this sense. While Daniel Kish and the blind children he teaches to develop echo-location DO gain the ability to form a colorless, textureless mental image of their surroundings, they don’t quite regain the ability to ‘see’ in the sense that non vision impaired people would understand it.

They do however regain *their own form* of ‘sight,’ which endows them with a radically higher degree of independence and autonomy. This IS because of how they change their expectations, and that’s the point. If you think you can become batman or you think you can’t, either way you get to be right.
