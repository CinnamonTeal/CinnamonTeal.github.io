title: Finally Rolling My Own Blog
---


Holy shit what a pain in the ass...

I have been struggling with Jekyll and Github pages all weekend. After using Medium.com as my blogging platform, I decided it wasn't fitting of a web dev in training to blog on such a 'writerly' platform and that I should build my own. All of the posts written before today's date were actually posted on medium, but were later migrated over to this blog. So this is technically my first post here using jekyll.

Finally I got this thing up and running. Not in the best shape, but respectable. More to come.
