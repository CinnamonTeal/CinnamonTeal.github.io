title: On Optimism, a response to Mr. R.S. Braithwaite
---

Recently at a meeting for couch-surfers in Berlin, I asked a new acquaintance whether he thought ‘the glass’ was half empty or half full. We’ve all heard this question, and we all know where it leads. What it’s really asking is, “are you an optimist or a pessimist?” There are only two obvious answers, but to my bemusement he replied “it depends on whether you are drinking or pouring.”

I pondered that for a moment.

The idea that “nothing is either good or bad, but thinking makes it so” has been somewhat of a mantra for me since I first read Hamlet, and more or less describes my attitude towards life. There are very few absolutes, almost everything is relative, and with the exception of real, medically diagnosed chemical imbalances (such as clinical depression), the way we see the world can be a choice that we make. I find that thought liberating.

I haven’t put much mental work into solving the problem of optimism vs pessimism for myself in a while, until being asked today to read a blog post titled "[Optimism](http://braythwayt.com/homoiconic/2009/05/01/optimism.html)," by [Reginald Braithwaite](http://braythwayt.com/). The big takeaway for me is nicely distilled in his following quote:

>“Optimists explain good things as being personal, general, and permanent, and explain away bad things as being impersonal, specific, and temporary. And if you point out the contradiction in their explanations, they see no contradiction. To them, the bad stuff really isn’t about them, it’s just that one thing that one time.”

This already gels nicely with my perspective that our attitudes towards life (can be) highly plastic, but a new gem for me is thinking of my attitude along three specific axes outlined by Dr. Martin Seligman in his book “Learned Optimism”: 1) personal vs impersonal, 2) general vs specific, and 3) permanent vs temporary.

As Mr. Braithwaite pointed out, we may or may not always be aware of how our brains are constantly evaluating each moment or experience as “good” or “bad,” and often along the above mentioned axes. Someone else already explained it better than I, so check out his [blog](http://braythwayt.com/homoiconic/2009/05/01/optimism.html), or better yet, buy the [book](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1400078393?ie=UTF8&tag=raganwald001-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1400078393). But for my part, I am excited to have a new mental toolset that I can use to more intentionally craft an optimistic outlook.

As I begin my coursework at the Flatiron School, I can expect to be challenged, maybe at times frustrated, maybe at times invigorated by the sensation of new synaptic connections being forged. But if I fail at something, I will choose to see that as just one thing that I failed at (specific), only one time (temporary), and that it’s a stepping stone rather than a stumbling block (impersonal). As of today I am (personal) a developer, a (generally) talented one (permanent), and I now see even more clearly than before how I can choose the ways in which I interpret and respond to this new experience.
