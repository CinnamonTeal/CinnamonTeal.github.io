One of the most beautiful and fascinating concepts I have encountered: Cellular Automata. Available definitions are pretty dense and dry, but roughly speaking, celluar automata are repeating patterns that are created by individual cells which propagate according to very simple rules. Commonly each cell be in only one of two states (on or off, 1 or 0), but other patterns can be made by increasing the number of possible states for each cell (like a color, for example) The rules describe how the cell should propagate depending on its relationship to its neighbors.

The history is interesting and important, but read it on [Wikipedia:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton) because I'm not interested in covering that here.

[Stephen Wolfram](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eC14GonZnU) wrote an amazingly comprehensive book covering this topic called "A New Kind of Science," which he says took 10 years to write. You can [read it](https://www.wolframscience.com/) online for free.

What I love about this, is how complexity emerges from a set of simple rules. It reminds me of what a seemingly deterministic yet simultaneously random universe we live in. The behavior of cellular automata are useful models of so many natural phenomena, such as the inherent randomness in fluid dynamics or the organic development of an entity as complex as a human being from a set of simple instructions like DNA. So we can study these patterns to try and learn about how complex structures emerge in nature. 

Let me explain the rules. I am going to go fast because this is a blog post, but if you want to take the time to really grok this check out [Wolfram Mathworld](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/ElementaryCellularAutomaton.html).

A one-dimensonal (or Elementary) automaton is the simplest kind of cellular automaton. The rules look like this:

![alt 1d](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/images/eps-gif/ElementaryCA30Rules_750.gif)

In this case the cells can only be 1 or 0, and each next generation changes based on the rules described in the image above. What happens when you repeat this pattern for severl generations is you eventually get an image that looks like this:

![alt rule](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/images/eps-gif/ElementaryCA30_1000.gif)

So far this isn't particularly amazing. If we program a cell with simple rules, we would expect to see regular and predictable behavior, like the above pattern. But we can study the behavior of these automata even further. What if we change the rules a bit? After 10 generations, nothing spectacular happens, but what if we run the experiment 100 generations, or 1000 generations? 

Stephen Wolfram did exactly that in the 80's and 90's. He suspected that the types of rules that can be embodied in computer programs, might actually be the types of rules that govern nature. So he systematically ran an experiment on all 256 possible simplest cellular automaton rules to see what would happen.

Here are some of the patterns that emerge:

Pay close attention to Rule #30. Here it is close up:

![alt rule30](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/images/gifs/Rule30Big.jpg)

What is the pattern that you see here? If you look on the left side of rule number 30 there appears to be some consistent structures, but in the center and towards the right it appears actually very random. And it is. There is something about rule 30 that produces inherent randomness. And rule 30 isn't the only one. Check out rule 110:

![alt rule110](http://nicholasyager.com/assets/2014-04-29/rule110.png)

The implications of this are huge. What can we infer from these structures about the basic principles of nature? It might be tempting to think that something very complex must also at its root be very very complex, or have been generated by an equally complex process, but what these cellular automata suggest is that we can get extremely complex structures or behavior from even the simplest of rules. 

This may suggest how human beings can appear to have free will; we behave in seemingly random and unpredictable ways, even though we know that we are bound by the physical laws of the universe. One might be tempted to explain the appearance of having free will as evidence for some sort of a god. But once you see how enormous complexity can emerge in nature from such a simple set of rules, it seems almost inevitable that we would witness the types of randomness and emergence of complexity in our universe, such as turbulence in dynamic fluid systems, the behavior of colliding subatomic particles, and the decision making processes of the brain. With cellular automata we are able to actually define a feature space of all of the mathematically possible patterns based on constrained parameters, and test their outcomes. 

Remember that the above one-dimensional cellular automata are the simplest kind. What if we add new dimensions or vary parameters? We can add color, or use algorithms such as k-nearest neighbors in a two-dimensional field. The most famous example of this is Conway's "Game of Life" discovered by J. H. Conway in 1970. It is a [totalistic cellular automaton](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/TotalisticCellularAutomaton.html), with a [Moore neighborhood range](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/MooreNeighborhood.html) of 1:

And we can try changing the rules even more. Here are [more rules](http://www.mirekw.com/ca/rullex_1dbi.html) to explore. Take something like a [Turing Machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine) for example:

![alt turing](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/images/eps-gif/BusyBeaverS_901.gif) 

In the above example, only one cell gets updated each generation, rather that the multiple cells of the previous examples. But even in a simpler system which mimics a Turing Machine, randomness naturally emerges.

**Examples of this are everywhere:**

**Not simply in computing simulations, but even (or perhaps especially) in nature.**

![alt shells](http://www.aimfeld.ch/cellmorphs/img/shells1.jpg)![alt mollusks](http://ca.olin.edu/2005/cellular_automata/molluscs.png)

The example of the shells above is particularly interesting, because if we look at different species of mollusks, we see a wide range of patterns. But it turns out that each of these patterns corresponds almost exactly to a very simple cellular automata programs, as if nature is just randomly generating any or all of the possible outcomes of these algorithms.

Another perfect example is shapes of leaves:

![alt leaves](http://scioly.org/wiki/images/thumb/8/81/ForestryLeafShapes.png/600px-ForestryLeafShapes.png)

It might seem like the varying shapes of leaves are too complex to ever be described with a single simple rule, but actually a very simple program which involves successive repeated branching produces almost all of the varying shapes of leaves. By simply varying a small parameter, you finish with a completely different structure, and these varying branched structures look almost exactly like real types of leaves: 

![alt branching](http://www.allenpike.com/images/461/2d-plants.png)

If you lay out all of the possible shapes you can get, you can summarize features of potential leaves in a parameter space set, which turns out to be a simple analog of the Mandelbrot Set. 

Ultimately the trend is the same: we see how surprisingly complex structures or behavior, even randomness, emerge from very simple rules. 

So what do we do with all of this? From a practical perspective, by studying cellular we can perhaps offer new methods for developing technology (for example nano), which give us algorithms that more closely model the way systems emerge in nature. But from a philosophical perspective we can hopefully understand more about the fundamental character of science, mathematics and nature, and our place in the universe.

If this subject interests you at all, please take the time (~1.5hrs) to watch [this lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eC14GonZnU) by Stephen Wolfram, who explains this topic far more thoroughly, brilliantly and eloquently than I have here, and from whom much of my understanding of this topic is derived.
