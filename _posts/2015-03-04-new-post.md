<!-- - blog - about Structs in ruby (what they are, how they work, how to use them, why they're awesome) -->

I recently learned about a new Ruby class called [Struct](http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.0/Struct.html).

Normally when creating a new class, it needs to be initialized with a minimal group of methods known as 'setters' and 'getters,' or 'readers' and 'writers' which allow you to give and get information about that class. The setup looks like this:

{% highlight Ruby %}
class Person

# this sets the name
def name=(n)
  @name = n
end

# this gets the name 
def name
  @name
end

{% endhighlight %}

<!-- Structs are used to create super simple classes with some instance variables and a simple constructor. Check it: -->
