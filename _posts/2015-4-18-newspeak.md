This week was the first out of three weeks we will be working on our next and more ambitious rails app. The concept I came up with for my app is a citizen journalism site which aims to improve the quality of news by decentralizing it, encouraging more fact-based reporting, and introducing a mechanism for quality control via a reputation economy. 

One thing that has always irked me, is how speculative, sensational, and uninformative news really tends to be. Also, many professional journalists can't even report the real stories they feel the public needs to know about, because of top down censorship (fox news anyone?). I envision this app being an important medium for serious professional journalists, as well as local community members who simply want to contribute important facts and evidence to the collective conversation around events. 

Features:

  1. I wanted to introduce something commonly seen in scientific literature, but almost never seen in journalism: the abstract. The purpose of this is bifold: first, it saves readers time by floating the bottom line to the top, and second, it encourages more fact based reporting because the abstract is intended to be a simple roadmap of the big picture where the relevant facts are introduced. For readers and writers who enjoy more dialogue and creative writing in their news, they can scroll down to the body of the article, but for those of us (myself included) who sometimes feel overwhelmed by the sheer amount of news to stay on top of, it will hopefully be a welcoming change to get to the point first. 

  2. Cited Sources: again I wanted to bring a more academic integrity to journalism, by requiring users to cite their sources. In many instances I envision a cited source to simply be firsthand evidence, such as a youtube video that the author recorded from their mobile device. This has obvious implications, for example, holding police accountable when they violate rights, or providing links to scientific journals where false claims in the mainstream media can be fact checked. 

  3. Reputation economy: if your news column is unreliable, it won't get a great reating, and that's as it should be. This works very well for reddit, so for this project we want to emulate something similar.

  4. Compensation: Tipping buttons on each article page incentivises users to create quality content, and to support reliable sources of information. 

In the first week we were able to configure all of our rails routes and controllers, and create all of the showpages for each of the sections of our app. Next week we will fill out more of the features, such as advanced search and tagging by subject matter, and more interesting styling with javascript and css. Stay tuned!
