Does struggling to read the output of your ActiveRecord objects in the rails console piss you off too?

Then stop reading and install the [Hirb gem](https://github.com/cldwalker/hirb) right now.


```gem install hirb
  => true```

  Let's say you are working on a blogging platform in rails, and you have various models and associations such as users, articles, tags... whatever. Let's pop open the rails console to see what's going on with our database:


{% highlight bash %}
$ rails c
Loading development environment (Rails 4.2.0)
2.2.0 :001 > Article.all
{% endhighlight %}<br>
When you call Article.all, this is the output ActiveRecord will give you:<br><br>
  ```Article Load (4.0ms)  SELECT "articles".* FROM "articles"
 => #<ActiveRecord::Relation [#<Article id: 1, title: "Liberty Square Raied by NYPD", abstract: "Liberty Square (Zuccotti Park), home of Occupy Wal...", sources: "[\"http://www.nycga.net/2011/11/liberty-square-bein...", body: "TIMELINE OF EVENTS:\n6:05 a.m. Liberty Square has b...", rep: 10, author_id: 2, created_at: "2015-04-23 18:20:12", updated_at: "2015-04-23 18:20:12">, #<Article id: 2, title: "COMMUNIQUE FROM CAIRO RE: EGYPT TRIP", abstract: "Occupy General Assembly passed a proposal authoriz...", sources: "http://www.nycga.net/2011/11/communique-from-cairo...", body: "To our kindred occupiers in Zuccotti park,\n\nWhen w...", rep: 5, author_id: 2, created_at: "2015-04-23 18:20:12", updated_at: "2015-04-23 18:20:12">, #<Article id: 3, title: "Updated Secret Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement...", abstract: "Today, Thursday 16 October 2014, WikiLeaks release...", sources: "https://wikileaks.org/tpp-ip2/", body: "Today, Thursday 16 October 2014, WikiLeaks release...", rep: 5, author_id: 2, created_at: "2015-04-23 18:20:12", updated_at: "2015-04-23 18:20:12">, #<Article id: 4, title: "Secret Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement (TPP) -...", abstract: "WikiLeaks releases today the \"Investment Chapter\" ...", sources: "https://wikileaks.org/tpp-investment/", body: "WikiLeaks releases today the \"Investment Chapter\" ...", rep: 5, author_id: 3, created_at: "2015-04-23 18:20:12", updated_at: "2015-04-23 18:20:12">, #<Article id: 5, title: "The Big Cheat: Why Teachers Are Going to Prison Wh...", abstract: "12 educators who went on trial for 'inflating test...", sources: "Jeff Bryant, http://www.alternet.org/education/big...", body: "No one likes a cheater.\n\nSo you’d think plenty of ...", rep: 4, author_id: 4, created_at: "2015-04-23 18:20:12", updated_at: "2015-04-23 18:20:12">, #<Article id: 6, title: "NEWS & POLITICS\nCop Who Shot and Killed 7-Year-Old...", abstract: "Aiyana Stanley-Jones was murdered by officer Josep...", sources: "By Cassandra Fairbanks / The Free Thought Project", body: "Detroit, MI– Officer Joseph Weekley had not been o...", rep: 5, author_id: 3, created_at: "2015-04-23 18:20:12", updated_at: "2015-04-23 18:20:12">, #<Article id: 7, title: "Police Cadet Quits Academy, Reports Cops After Wit...", abstract: "District Attorney Kari Brandenburg has provided ne...", sources: "http://www.alternet.org/police-cadet-quits-academy...", body: "Few details are known about what exactly transpire...", rep: 2, author_id: 1, created_at: "2015-04-23 18:20:12", updated_at: "2015-04-23 18:20:12">, #<Article id: 8, title: "Better battery imaging paves way for renewable ene...", abstract: "n a move that could improve the energy storage of ...", sources: "http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/04/15042...", body: "In a move that could improve the energy storage of...", rep: 5, author_id: 2, created_at: "2015-04-23 18:20:12", updated_at: "2015-04-23 18:20:12">, #<Article id: 9, title: "Our Love Of Puppy Dog Eyes Explained By Science", abstract: "Researchers found a spike in oxytocin occurs in bo...", sources: "Newsy / Powered by NewsLook.com", body: "See Video", rep: 1, author_id: 4, created_at: "2015-04-23 18:20:12", updated_at: "2015-04-23 18:20:12">, #<Article id: 10, title: "Getting a better grasp of primate grip", abstract: "In a new study, a research team found that even th...", sources: "http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/04/15042...", body: "Scientists are coming to grips with the superior g...", rep: 5, author_id: 3, created_at: "2015-04-23 18:20:12", updated_at: "2015-04-23 18:20:12">, ...]> ```

 Ugly as shit and almost impossible to read. I mean you can read it, but really, it's annoying. And it also really slows you down. Do this instead: 

{% highlight bash %}
$ rails c
Loading development environment (Rails 4.2.0)
2.2.0 :001 > Hirb.enable
 => true 
2.2.0 :002 > Article.all
  Article Load (12.5ms)  SELECT "articles".* FROM "articles"

Clearly this is a thousand times better. Seriously this gem saved my sanity. Now you can read your data table since it actually looks like a data table, and it really speeds up your development, which is priceless. 

Some downsides/things to keep in mind: 
  - Everytime you restart the console you have to call Hirb.enable. 
  - Also, this gem works best when you don't have too many columns. In the example above, you might notice that it's necessary to scroll horizontally to see all of the table columns. At the time of this writing I haven't figured out how to enable horizontal scrolling in terminal (not like I'd want to), but this means that Hirb is limited to use cases where you can fit all of your columns on your screen, either by typing "Cmd -" a bunch of times to shrink the text in your terminal, or simply having a limited number of columns - otherwise the columns will get smashed up on the screen and then it defeats the whole purpose. 

  I haven't run into this problem yet so for the most part this gem still kicks ass and will save you a shit ton of time in most cases. Happy coding!
