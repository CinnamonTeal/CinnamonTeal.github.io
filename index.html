        <p>This blog post is in response to Gerard Oneill's post, found here: https://medium.com/backchannel/techs-high-barrier-to-entry-for-the-underprivileged-da254356547d</p>


        <p><strong>What are the barriers we as the most diverse Fellowship class that is non college educated will face once we enter the working world?</strong></p>

        <p>These barriers will be unique for each of us, depending on what we look like and how we present ourselves, combined with the biases and perceptions of those we interview with. Several of my classmates have identified a lack of college degree as a potential obstacle, and in some cases, I agree. It seems however that the socially perceived value of a college degree is diminishing, as people come to value skill and ability over pedigree. It is frequently discussed that a college degree is seen as a status symbol, and from certain perspectives I think this is true. Although I did not graduate, on occasion I find it convenient to mention that I attended Columbia University, in an attempt to benefit that status symbol.</p>


        <p><strong>What is code switching, and is it something we should have to do?</strong></p>
        <p>Code-switching — the practice of shifting the languages you use or the way you express yourself in your conversations. In an ideal world, no this isn't something that we should be forced to do. But in the real world, being able to do so can be a valuable social skill. Like anything else, it depends on how you frame it. A compassionate perspective can see code-switching as an attempt to facilitate communication and mutual understanding, while a cynical one can see it as an insincere attempt at social manipulation, or worse, as an unconscious sacrificing of one's cultural identities as a response to feeling like an outsider (a response that those generally recognized as the "majority" or the "norm" likely do not experience).</p>


        <p><strong>Should we change ourselves so that other people will understand us?</strong></p>
        <p>Define changing ourselves. As a matter of permanent changes to ones identity, I think not. But I also try to do as the Romans do (only when in Rome, of course).</p>

        <p><strong>What does it mean to be an effective communicator?</strong></p>
        <p>A communication is an exchange. It requires both the effective receiving and transmitting of ideas. The goal is always mutual understanding, as best can be achieved. Effective receiving to me is listening with the intention of truly understanding the cares and concerns, motivations, etc of the other person/group. Effective transmitting to me is taking all of what has been received so far into consideration, in order to discover what needs to be transmitted and how, in order best achieve the goal of mutual understanding.</p>

        <p><strong>What do we have to do to be respected, listened to, and heard?</strong></p>
        <p>Give the same to others.</p>

        <p><strong>Do you believe the field you’re about to enter wants you to succeed?</strong></p>
        <p>In as much as something abstract like a 'field' can be personified, yes. If we think of the 'field' as the tech industry at large, and we take into consideration the frequently discussed dearth of skilled workers, then as a developing skilled worker in this field I can only imagine that my help is needed and that my arrival would more often than not be warmly welcomed.</p>

        <p><strong>How can we as a class challenge people’s preconceptions of who we are?</strong></p>
        <p>By being something other than what their preconceptions are. Personally I recommend not worrying about what other peoples' preconceptions are, because it will naturally differ from person to person, and all we can do is be our best selves. Furthermore, our sense of self worth can only come from ourselves, and wasting mental processes on the hypothetical (and unknowable) perceptions of others, will only serve to erode our sense of self worth in addition to wasting time that could better be spent enjoying our lives and feeling grateful for what we DO have.</p>
